# Retail_Sales_Prediction
 This is an Regression project to predict the sales 
 Rossman operates over 3000 drug stores in 7 Europian countries in which there are two datasets given. The ultimate goal is to find insights from the data and fit machine learning model to pridict the sales. There are two dataset in which one dataset has information on storeid,sales,customers,promotions and holidays and the other dataset has store,assortment type, store type, promotion intervals and some information on competition.
In this project I have done Data manipulation and conducted basic Exploratory data Analysis 
I have done some Hypothesis testing to get some conclusions
To build machine Learning Model I have done Feature Engineering and Data Pre Processing and then built diffrent types of machine Learning Model and came up with the best model that has the highest accuracy with least amount of Errors (RMSE)
Lastly I came with some Features that plays an important role in Sales prediction by using feature_importances_
